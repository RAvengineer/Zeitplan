            <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Zeitplan">Zeitplan</a> is a German word, that means Timetable.<br>
            A Timetable Management web app for <b>VITians</b>.<br>

            For all VITians, checking the timetable after each lecture is essential. Most commonly used method for the process is keeping a photograph of the timetable, and checking it after each class. But, this sounds tedious!
        </p>

            So, how about you get notified about the next lecture just when a lecture ends. With 1.5 billion Google accounts world-wide, Google Calendar can be used for this purpose, instead of creating an app - which would be like re-inventing the wheels! And on top of that, the website won't ask you to add the slots and lectures manually! 
        </p>
        <p>
            All you have to do is to copy-paste the timetable on VTOP and few details about the events, and then all the lectures will be added to your Calendar Account as Events.
            Now, you will be able to see next lecture's details in your notification bar and popup, provide you have Google Calendar app installed.
            For more, you can use the Calendar Widget to get your lecture details on home screen in a more organised manner.
